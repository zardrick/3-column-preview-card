## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (SCSS) for styling

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Using **Sass (SCSS)** for modular and maintainable stylesheets.
- Implementing a **mobile-first approach** for responsiveness.
- Centering elements using `display: flex` and `min-height: 100vh`.

Here is an example of centering the wrapper:

```scss
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan to:


- Enhance **accessibility** by improving ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me understand flexbox better.
- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - Great reference for writing maintainable stylesheets.
